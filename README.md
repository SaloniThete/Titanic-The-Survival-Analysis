# Titanic-The-Survival-Analysis
This is a personal project I worked on using python. The project uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and performing analysis on passengers that survived and those that did not survive.The goal of this repository is to provide an example of an analysis for those interested in getting into the field of data analytics or using python for Kaggle's Data Science competitions.
# Data can be Found at: [Titanic Dataset](D:\\saloni\\saloni\\titanic_train.csv)

## The Notebook will show basic examples of:
### Data Handling
  - Importing Data with Pandas
  - Cleaning Data
  - Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib

### Data Analysis
  - Supervised Machine learning Techniques: + Logit Regression Model + Plotting results + Support Vector Machine (SVM) using 3 kernels + Basic Random Forest + Plotting results.
